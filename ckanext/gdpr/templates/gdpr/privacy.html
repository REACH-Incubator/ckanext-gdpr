Aggregated data previously anonymized about collected information regarding REACH incubation will be generated and published publicly. </span></p>
    <p><h2>Legal ground &ndash; What is the legal basis to process your personal data? </h2></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By accepting our Terms of Service, we have entered a pre-contractual relationship by which we provide you access to the REACH Data Catalogue. Therefore, the legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the contractual necessity. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provision of your personal data is optional, but in the absence of the requested data, we will be unable to provide you access to the REACH Data Catalogue.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we send you any dissemination or communication information about our activities and services or carry out any profiling about your interactions with us, this will be exclusively about the REACH project.</span></p>
    <p><h2>Data Recipients &ndash;Who will be the recipients of your personal data? </h2></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal data will be shared with Deusto Foundation, an entity based in Spain with a legal link to University of Deusto. Processing your request does not involve the transfer of your personal data to other third parties, unless otherwise provided by law. Nor does it involve the international transfer of said information. </span></p>
    <p><h2>Preservation &ndash; How long will we keep your data?</h2></p>
    <ul>

    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data needed to send communications related to the EDI project and profiles will be kept until the person concerned explicitly requests their records to be removed.</span></li>
